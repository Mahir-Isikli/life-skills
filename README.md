### 📄 Resume Creator

<table>

<td width="50%" align="center">
<strong>❌ Don't let your resume look like this</strong><br><br>
<img src="assets/before.png?v=2" width="100%" alt="Bad resume example">
</td>
<td width="50%" align="center">
<strong>✅ When it could look like this</strong><br><br>

The difference? First-principles thinking, proper typography, and actually understanding what hiring managers look for.

**What it does:**
- Reads your current resume + LinkedIn (via screenshots — Claude can't directly access LinkedIn)
- Researches the target company (culture, tech stack, what they value)
- Applies Paul Graham's hiring philosophy for startup roles
- Creates clean LaTeX Harvard-style formatting
- Iteratively refines by converting PDF → image → visual review

**How to use:**
```
Help me update my resume for [role] at [company].
Here's my current resume: [attach PDF]
LinkedIn: [attach screenshots of your profile, experience, and posts]
```
